# MentalMathTUI

Using [Espeak](https://github.com/Harium/espeak-java), [Random](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html) and [Apache NumberUtils](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/math/NumberUtils.html). Built with Gradle.

## How to set up?

Clone the project
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Garenium/MentalMathTUI.git
``` 

Run ``./run.sh``

You may need openjdk-11 and espeak installed by default (if you don't have them, run.sh checks them for you. You are free to check it).

For first time users, Wait 1-2 minute(s) until the project starts accordingly.
